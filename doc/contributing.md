# How to start

Why develop new products from ground up when there are **open source** projects available for copying?<br/>
Select a popular **open source** project, **fork** it, add an admin interface for customization, and record a video showcasing the project for pre-release.

## What to work with

**Open source** projects based on the blockchain technology.

## <a name="contributing0"></a> Stage 0 - Idea (developer)

One of the key criteria when searching for a project is the amount of users or commission it generates, as this number correlates with its popularity.<br/>

The examples for idea sources:

- [Gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)
- [Dappradar](https://dappradar.com/)
- [Defipulse](https://www.defipulse.com/defi-list)
- [Cryptototem](https://cryptototem.com/ico-list/)
- [Golden](https://golden.com/query/list-of-cryptocurrency-companies-E5Y)
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=fork&source=main_banner&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=fork)
- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/services/search?q=fork)

Once you come up with an idea:

0. Study the documentation for the original project ([What to look for in documentation?](./faq.md#what-do-i-look-for-in-documentation))
0. Locate the **primary** repository ([How do I locate the primary repository?](./faq.md#how-do-i-locate-the-primary-repository)).
0. Locate any **secondary** repositories ([How do I locate the secondary repositories?](./faq.md#how-do-i-locate-secondary-repositories))
0. Come up with a product name ([How do I come up with a product name?](./faq.md#how-do-i-come-up-with-a-product-name))
