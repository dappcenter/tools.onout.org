# Participation as a developer

The project unites a group of independent developers by providing comfortable working conditions.

## How it works

Let us assume that three developers release products A, B, and C. These products vary in demand: while product A covers the development costs and generates income, product B only covers the development costs, and product C does not cover the development costs entirely. If the developers of the projects A, B, and C combine their projects, they can all cover the costs of development and receive income.<br/>
Each developer contributes to team stability by committing his project to the [project catalogue](https://tools.onout.org). As the amount of projects in the catalogue grows, the catalogue becomes more popular, gains trust, rises in demand, and generates more stable income.

## Payments

### General terms and conditions

The developers either receive payments on fixed hourly rate, or as a share of income. <br/>
Hourly rate depends on developer experience and skills and is subject to individual negotiation. <br/>
Payments are delivered in cryptocurrency.

### Conditions for initial payment

In order to receive the initial payment for the project, it is required to submit its complete source code into [team repository](https://github.com/noxonsu).

## Responsibilities of the parties

### Developer responsibilities

- to generate an idea ([stage 0](#stage-0---idea-developer))
- to develop a product ([stage 3](#stage-3-–-product-development-developer))

### The tools.onout.org team guarantees

- to review the product idea ([stage 1](#stage-1-–-review-team))
- to assess potential demand for the product ([stage 2](#stage-2-–-demand-validation-team))

# How to start

Why develop new products from ground up when there are **open source** projects available for copying?<br/>
Select a popular **open source** project, **fork** it, add an admin interface for customization, and record a video showcasing the project for pre-release.

## What to work with

**Open source** projects based on the blockchain technology.

## Stage 0 - Idea (developer)

One of the key criteria when searching for a project is the amount of commission it generates, as this number correlates with its popularity.<br/>
The examples for idea sources:

- [gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)
- [dappradar](https://dappradar.com/)
- [defipulse](https://www.defipulse.com/defi-list)
- [cryptototem](https://cryptototem.com/ico-list/)
- [golden](https://golden.com/query/list-of-cryptocurrency-companies-E5Y)
- [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=fork&source=main_banner&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=fork)
- [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/services/search?q=fork)

Once you come up with an idea:

0. Study the documentation for the original project ([What to look for in documentation?](./faq.md#что-интересует-в-документации))
0. Locate the **primary** repository ([How do I locate the primary repository?](./faq.md#как-найти-основной-репозиторий)).
0. Locate any **secondary** repositories ([How do I locate the secondary repositories?](./faq.md#как-найти-дополнительные-репозитории))
0. Come up with a product name ([How do I come up with a product name?](./faq.md#как-придумать-название-продукта))

Present your idea following the [template](./templates/idea.md) and send the result to our [email](mailto:support@onout.org).

## Stage 1 – Review (team)

The tools.onout.org team reviews the idea and provides feedback with resolution: 

- the idea is approved for development
- the idea is returned for revision

## Stage 2 – Demand validation (team)

The tools.onout.org team pitches the idea to potential clients through the [Ideas](https://dash.onout.org/#/presale) section of the website. Potential demand for the product is then assessed by client voting.

## Stage 3 – Product development (developer)

See this [guide](./development.md) for details on development process.
